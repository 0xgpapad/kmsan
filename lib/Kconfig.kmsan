	  KMSAN is a dynamic detector of uses of uninitialized memory in the
	  kernel. It is based on compiler instrumentation provided by Clang
	  and thus requires Clang 10.0.0+ to build.

	  Test suite for KMSAN, testing various error detection scenarios,
	  and checking that reports are correctly output to console.

	  Say Y here if you want the test to be built into the kernel and run
	  during boot; say M if you want the test to build as a module; say N
	  if you are unsure.
